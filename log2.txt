The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply. Your question was:
  Did you say, "Watch the sheeps," or "Wash the sheets"? How can I know
  which is which? 

And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
  The sheep are the ones that object when you try to make them fit into
  the washing machine.
